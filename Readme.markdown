# AJNotificationView

__Notice component for iOS__

- No images needed, all CoreGraphics code
- Works on iPhone and iPad (resolution independent)
- Animated background type
- Only one notification is shown at
a time. When a notification is created, it is added to the queue. If it is the
only notification in the queue, then its delay interval is honored. If it is not
the only notification in the queue, it is placed at the end of the queue, and
then displayed without a delay once it reaches the front of the queue (Thanks to @DazeEnd).

``` objective-c

                               title:@"Test notification"
                     linedBackground:AJLinedBackgroundTypeAnimated
                           hideAfter:2.5f];
```


``` objective-c
// Orange notification without lined background. Remains visible until the user taps in it, or you call hide method
AJNotificationView *panel = [AJNotificationView showNoticeInView:self.view
                                type:AJNotificationTypeOrange
                               title:@"Test notification"
                     linedBackground:AJLinedBackgroundTypeDisabled
                           hideAfter:0];

                         linedBackground:AJLinedBackgroundTypeDisabled
                               hideAfter:2.5f
                                  offset:50.0f
                                   delay:1.0f
                                response:^{
                                    NSLog(@"User tap in the notification");
                                }
    ];
```


``` objective-c
// Notification with delay, offset, response block and detail disclosure button that send a notification when the user tap in it
//Thanks to @smoothdvd for this last feature

//In viewDidLoad register the NSNotification
- (void)viewDidLoad{   
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self
                                             selector:@selector(detailDisclosureButtonPressed:)
                                                 name:@"detail_disclosure_button_pressed"
                                               object:nil];
   [super viewDidLoad];
}

//...
//Function that's called when the NSNotification is fired
- (void)detailDisclosureButtonPressed:(NSNotification*)notification{
    NSLog(@"Detail disclosure button pressed");
}

//...
//The code for show the AJNotificationView

    [AJNotificationView showNoticeInView:self.view
                                    type:AJNotificationTypeBlue
                                   title:@"Detail disclosure notification"
                         linedBackground:AJLinedBackgroundTypeAnimated
                               hideAfter:2.5f
                                  offset:0.0f
                                   delay:0.0f
                        detailDisclosure:YES
                                response:^{
                                    NSLog(@"Response block");
                                }
     ];
```
